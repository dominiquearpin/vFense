=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: redhat-ds-base security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2008:0858-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise IPA
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0858.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0858.html</a>
Issue date:        2008-09-10
CVE Names:         CVE-2008-2930 CVE-2008-3283 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated redhat-ds-base packages are now available that fix security issues
and various bugs for Red Hat Enterprise IPA.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat IPA 1 for RHEL 5 Server - i386, x86_64

3. Description:

Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server.

Multiple memory leaks were identified in the Directory Server. An
unauthenticated remote attacker could use these flaws to trigger high
memory consumption in the Directory Server, possibly causing it to crash or
terminate unexpectedly when the server ran out of available memory.
(CVE-2008-3283)

Ulf Weltman of Hewlett-Packard discovered a flaw in the way Directory
Server handled LDAP search requests with patterns. A remote attacker with
access to the LDAP service could create a search request that, when the
search pattern was matched against specially crafted data records, caused
Directory Server to use a large amount of CPU time. Directory Server did
not impose time limits on such search requests. In this updated package,
Directory Server imposes a configurable limit on the pattern-search query
run time, with the default limit set to 30 seconds. (CVE-2008-2930)

In addition to these security fixes, the following bugs have been fixed in
these updated packages:

* The change sequence numbers in multi-master replication had a built-in
time skew to accommodate differences in the clocks on master servers. Under
certain circumstances, this skew exceeded the maximum allowable skew,
causing replication to stop entirely.
 
* If an entry with a large attribute value, such as over 32KB, was
replicated, the replication could fail with a DB_BUFFER_SMALL error. 

* If a password policy attribute such as accountunlocktime was added to an
entry, the server would attempt to replicate that attribute, causing
replication to fail. 

* In replication scenarios, if an attribute value was scheduled to be
deleted and also was indexed or had an attribute subtype which was indexed,
the Directory Server would crash during the index operation.

* On x86_64 systems, recursively adding groups as members to other groups 
could crash the server because the stack size for the memberOf plug-in on 
64-bit systems was hard-coded to 256KB, regardless of the ulimit value.

* A problem in the SASL IO handling meant that memory was not reallocated
after SASL binds. For example, a simple bind coming immediately after a
SASL bind might have failed.

All users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.0 should upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues.
