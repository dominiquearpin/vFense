                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: openstack-packstack security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2013:0595-01
Product:           Red Hat OpenStack
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0595.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0595.html</a>

=====================================================================

1. Summary:

An updated openstack-packstack package that fixes two security issues and
several bugs is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

OpenStack Folsom - noarch

3. Description:

PackStack is a command line utility that uses Puppet modules to support
rapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.
PackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof of concept
installations and more complex multi-node installations.

A flaw was found in PackStack. During manifest creation, the manifest file
was written to /tmp/ with a predictable file name. A local attacker could
use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting an arbitrary
file accessible to the user running PackStack with the contents of the
manifest, which could lead to a denial of service. Additionally, the
attacker could read and potentially modify the manifest being generated,
allowing them to modify systems being deployed using OpenStack.
(CVE-2013-0261)

It was discovered that the cinder.conf and all api-paste.ini configuration
files were created with world-readable permissions. A local attacker could
use this flaw to view administrative passwords, allowing them to control
systems deployed and managed by OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0266)

The CVE-2013-0261 issue was discovered by Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat
Security Response Team, and CVE-2013-0266 was discovered by Derek Higgins
of the Red Hat OpenStack team.

This update also fixes several bugs in the openstack-packstack package.

All users of openstack-packstack are advised to upgrade to this updated
package, which corrects these issues.
