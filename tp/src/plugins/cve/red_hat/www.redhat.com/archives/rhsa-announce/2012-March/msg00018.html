=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: rhevm security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2012:0421-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0421.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0421.html</a>
Issue date:        2012-03-26
CVE Names:         CVE-2012-0818 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated rhevm packages that fix one security issue and various bugs are now
available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

RHEV-M for Servers - x86_64

3. Description:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual machines running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. These packages also include the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager REST (Representational State Transfer) API, a set of
scriptable commands that give administrators the ability to perform queries
and operations on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
attacks. If a remote attacker who is able to access the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager REST API submitted a request containing an external
XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
(Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2012-0818)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously the REST API was ignoring the &quot;Accept&quot; header. This made it
impossible to retrieve detailed information about specific sub-collections,
including hosts and disks. The REST API has been updated and now processes
the &quot;Accept&quot; header as originally intended. (BZ#771369)

* The &quot;start_time&quot; Virtual Machine property was previously always set. This
meant that even Virtual Machines that were stopped, had a value for
&quot;start_time&quot;. An update has been made to ensure that the &quot;start_time&quot;
property is only set when the Virtual Machine has been started, and is
running. (BZ#772975)

* The 'rhevm-setup' script previously only ran successfully on systems with
their locale set to 'en_US.UTF-8', 'en_US.utf-8', or 'en_US.utf8'. The
script has since been updated to also run successfully in additional
locales, including 'ja_JP.UTF-8'. (BZ#784860)

* The REST API did not previously validate that all required parameters
were provided when enabling power management. The response code returned
would also incorrectly indicate the operation had succeeded where
mandatory parameters were not supplied. An update has been made to ensure
that the power management parameters are validated correctly. (BZ#785744)

* Previously no warning or error was issued when the amount of free disk
space on a host was low. When no free disk space remained on the host it
would become non-responsive with no prior warning. An update has been made
to report a warning in the audit log when a host's free disk space is less
than 1000 MB, and an error when a host's free disk space is less than 500
MB. (BZ#786132)

* When importing Virtual Machines no notification was provided if the MAC
address of the network interface card clashed with that of an existing
Virtual Machine. Now when this occurs a message is printed to the audit
log, highlighting the need for manual intervention. (BZ#795416)

* Previously it was not possible to set more, or less, than one value for
SpiceSecureChannels using the rhevm-config tool. This meant it was not
possible to encrypt all SPICE channels. The rhevm-config tool has been
updated and it is now possible to encrypt all SPICE channels, by adding
them to the SpiceSecureChannels configuration key. (BZ#784012)

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which address this vulnerability and fix these bugs.
