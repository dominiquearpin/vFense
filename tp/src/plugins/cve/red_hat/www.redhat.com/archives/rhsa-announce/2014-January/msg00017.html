=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Important: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.3.0 update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:0038-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0038.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0038.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-01-21
CVE Names:         CVE-2013-6434 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.3 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

RHEV-M 3.3 - noarch

3. Description:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
relayed SPICE connection information to remote-viewer when a native SPICE
client invocation method was used. As a result, remote-viewer attempted an
insecure connection first and only switched to a secure connection when
requested by the SPICE server. An attacker able to intercept the SPICE
connection could use this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.
(CVE-2013-6434)

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Samuel of Amcom for reporting this
issue.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section. 

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages, which resolve these issues and add these 
enhancements.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
