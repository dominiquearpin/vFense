                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Low: squirrelmail security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2013:0126-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0126.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0126.html</a>
Issue date:        2013-01-08
CVE Names:         CVE-2012-2124 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes one security issue and several
bugs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

RHEL Desktop Workstation (v. 5 client) - noarch
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v. 5 server) - noarch

3. Description:

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

The SquirrelMail security update RHSA-2012:0103 did not, unlike the erratum
text stated, correct the CVE-2010-2813 issue, a flaw in the way
SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A user preference file was
created when attempting to log in with a password containing an 8-bit
character, even if the username was not valid. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk space on the target
SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2012-2124)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, SquirrelMail could not decode multi-line subjects
properly. Consequently, the decode header internationalization option did
not properly handle new lines or tabs at the beginning of the lines. This
bug has been fixed and SquirrelMail now works correctly in the described
scenario. (BZ#241861)

* Due to a bug, attachments written in HTML code on the Windows operating
system were not displayed properly when accessed with SquirrelMail; the
&quot;!=null&quot; string was trimmed to &quot;!ull&quot;. This bug has been fixed and the
attachments are now displayed correctly in such a case. (BZ#359791)

* Previously, e-mail messages with a Unique Identifier (UID) larger than
2^31 bytes were unreadable when using the squirrelmail package. With this
patch the squirrelmail package is able to read all messages regardless of
the UIDs size. (BZ#450780)

* Due to a bug, a PHP script did not assign the proper character set to
requested variables. Consequently, SquirrelMail could not display any
e-mails. The underlying source code has been modified and now the
squirrelmail package assigns the correct character set. (BZ#475188)

* Due to the incorrect internationalization option located at the i18n.php
file, the squirrelmail package could not use the GB 2312 character set. The
i18n.php file has been fixed and the GB 2312 character set works correctly
in the described scenario. (BZ#508686)

* Previously, the preg_split() function contained a misspelled constant,
PREG_SPLIT_NI_EMPTY, which could cause SquirrelMail to produce error
messages. The name of the constant has been corrected to
PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY, and SquirrelMail no longer produces error messages in
this scenario. (BZ#528758)

* Due to Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) settings, sending e-mails from
the SquirrelMail web interface was blocked. This update adds a note to the
SquirrelMail documentation that describes how to set the SELinux options to
allow sending e-mails from the SquirrelMail web interface. (BZ#745380)

* Previously, the squirrelmail package did not comply with the RFC 2822
specification about line length limits. Consequently, attachments with
lines longer than 998 characters could not be forwarded using SquirrelMail.
This patch modifies the underlying source code and now SquirrelMail
complies with the RFC 2822 specification as expected. (BZ#745469)

* Prior to this update, the squirrelmail package required the php-common
script instead of the mod_php script during installation or upgrade of the
package, which led to a dependency error. As a result, attempting to
install or upgrade the squirrelmail package failed on systems using the
php53 packages. With this update, the dependencies of the squirrelmail
package were changed and the installation or upgrade now works correctly in
the described scenario. (BZ#789353)

All users of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains backported patches to correct these issues.
