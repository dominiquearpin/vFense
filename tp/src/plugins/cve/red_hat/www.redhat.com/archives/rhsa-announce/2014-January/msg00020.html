                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: openstack-heat security, bug fix, and enhancement update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:0090-01
Product:           Red Hat OpenStack
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0090.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0090.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-01-22
CVE Names:         CVE-2013-6426 CVE-2013-6428 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-heat packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

OpenStack 4 - noarch

3. Description:

The openstack-heat packages provide heat, a Python implementation of the
OpenStack Orchestration engine, to launch multiple composite cloud
applications based on templates.

It was found that heat did not properly enforce cloudformation-compatible
API policy rules. An in-instance attacker could use the CreateStack or
UpdateStack methods to create or update a stack, resulting in a violation
of the API policy. Note that only setups using Orchestration's
cloudformation-compatible API were affected. (CVE-2013-6426)

A flaw was found in the way Orchestration's REST API implementation handled
modified request paths. An authenticated remote user could use this flaw to
bypass the tenant-scoping restriction by modifying the request path,
resulting in privilege escalation. Note that only setups using
Orchestration's cloudformation-compatible API were affected.
(CVE-2013-6428)

Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as
the original reporter.

The openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. The most notable fixes and enhancements are:

* Auto-scaling has been fixed when AdjustmentType was set to
  PercentChangeInCapacity.

* A QPID broker restart no longer permanently disrupts subscribed clients.

* RPC requests are now only serviced by one server in a given topic group.

* Auto-scaling group growth or shrinkage has been fixed to utilize the full
  available size, regardless of the scaling policy adjustment.

(BZ#1045430)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The outdated heat-db-setup tool, which only supported local installs, has
been removed. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4
Installation and Configuration Guide has been updated to show how to create
the necessary database and associated tables for Orchestration, allowing
the deployment of the database server on a local or remote system (see
Installing the OpenStack Orchestration Service). (BZ#1046326)

* The heat-engine source code had a hard-coded reference to a Fedora image
name in the implementation of the AWS-compatible LoadBalancer resource.
This meant that you could not specify an alternative LoadBalancer image
name in deployments (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux). A new option
has been added to the Orchestration configuration file,
/etc/heat/heat.conf, which is named loadbalancer_template. The new
loadbalancer_template option can now be used to specify an alternate
LoadBalancer template that contains a different image name. (BZ#1048215)

* Due to a packaging error, the heat-manage tool was not working properly
(which prohibited a successful database creation). This error has been
fixed by moving the parallel package selection code so that all
Orchestration tools now use the proper packages for use at runtime.
(BZ#1048335)

All openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
