1. Summary:

Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security
issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

2. Description:

This Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0 release serves as a replacement for
6.0.0. Refer to the 6.1.0 Release Notes for further information, available
shortly from <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/">https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/</a>

It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
protected resource could bypass the CSRF prevention filter in JBoss Web. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to perform CSRF attacks against
applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter. (CVE-2012-4431)

When applications used the COOKIE session tracking method, the jsessionid
would be appended as a query string parameter when processing the first
request of a session. This could possibly lead to users' sessions being
hijacked via man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-4529)

If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class
name, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application
to be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications
using the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker
could deploy a malicious application that provides implementations of
custom authorization modules that apply authorization rules supplied by the
attacker. (CVE-2012-4572)

XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements, which is best
practice.

The data file used by PicketBox Vault to store encrypted passwords contains
a copy of its own admin key. The file is encrypted using only this admin
key, not the corresponding JKS key. A local attacker with permission to
read the vault data file could read the admin key from the file.
(CVE-2013-1921)

A session fixation flaw was found in the Tomcat FormAuthenticator module.
(CVE-2013-2067)

When a JGroups channel was started, the JGroups diagnostics service was
enabled by default with no authentication via IP multicast. An attacker on
an adjacent network could exploit this flaw to read diagnostics
information. (CVE-2013-2102)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Apache CXF StAX
parser implementation processed certain XML files. A remote attacker could
provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to
excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2013-2160)

A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
XML signature, via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

A flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on
an adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful
authentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information and
attain limited remote code execution. (CVE-2013-4112)

A flaw was discovered in the way authenticated connections were cached on
the server by remote-naming. After a user has successfully logged in, a
remote attacker could use a remoting client to log in as that user without
knowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform actions
with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4128)

A flaw was discovered in the way connections for remote EJB invocations via
the EJB client API were cached on the server. After a user has successfully
logged in, a remote attacker could use an EJB client to log in as that user
without knowing their password. (CVE-2013-4213)

3. Solution:

Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575; and
Andreas Falkenberg of SEC Consult Deutschland GmbH, and Christian Mainka,
Juraj Somorovsky, and Joerg Schwenk of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting
CVE-2013-2160. CVE-2012-4572 was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat
JBoss EAP Quality Engineering team; CVE-2013-4128 and CVE-2013-4213 were
discovered by Wolf-Dieter Fink of the Red Hat GSS Team; and CVE-2013-2102
was discovered by Red Hat.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up all
applications deployed on JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all
customized configuration files, and any databases and database settings.
