    "Descriptions": "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2014-1493, CVE-2014-1510, CVE-2014-1511, CVE-2014-1512,\nCVE-2014-1513, CVE-2014-1514)\n\nSeveral information disclosure flaws were found in the way Thunderbird\nprocessed malformed web content. An attacker could use these flaws to gain\naccess to sensitive information such as cross-domain content or protected\nmemory addresses or, potentially, cause Thunderbird to crash.\n(CVE-2014-1497, CVE-2014-1508, CVE-2014-1505)\n\nA memory corruption flaw was found in the way Thunderbird rendered certain\nPDF files. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a malicious\nextension could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2014-1509)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Benoit Jacob, Olli Pettay, Jan Varga, Jan de Mooij,\nJesse Ruderman, Dan Gohman, Christoph Diehl, Atte Kettunen, Tyson Smith,\nJesse Schwartzentruber, John Thomson, Robert O'Callahan, Mariusz Mlynski,\nJ\u00fcri Aedla, George Hotz, and the security research firm VUPEN as the\noriginal reporters of these issues.\n\nNote: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted\nHTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.\nThey could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when\nviewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.\n\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\nadvisories for Thunderbird 24.4.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla\nadvisories in the References section of this erratum.\n\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains Thunderbird version 24.4.0, which corrects these issues.\nAfter installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes\nto take effect.",
